<ul style="color: white;">
	<li><font size="5">Anyone can invest in NFTs. Investing in tokenized assets is accessible to everyone. Asset ownership that is tokenized into an NFT can more easily and efficiently be transferred among people anywhere in the world.</font></li>
    <li><font size="5">NFT ownership is secured by a blockchain. Using blockchain technology to digitally signify ownership can make an investor's ownership of an asset more secure. Blockchain tech can also make ownership of assets more transparent.</font></li>
    <li><font size="5">It's an opportunity to learn more about blockchain technology. Investors can become more knowledgeable about blockchain, while diversifying their portfolios, by allocating a small sum to tokenized assets.</font></li>
</ul>
<h1><b style="color: white;">Why Do People Invest in NFTs?</b></h1>
<p><font size="5" style="color:white;">Investors buy NFTs for many reasons. Some are keenly interested in owning the underlying asset, while others may perceive value in the asset being tokenized into an NFT. Others may invest in NFTs as a way to learn more about blockchain technology.</font></p>
<h1><b style="color:white;">Are NFTs a Good Investment?</b></h1>
<p><font size="5" style="color:white;">Investing in an asset just because it's tokenized into an NFT is not a good idea. NFTs by themselves are not investments, so make sure to understand the value of the underlying asset that you are buying before you purchase the NFT.</font></p>
<h1><b style="color:white;">How Can I Invest in NFTs?</b></h1>
<p><font size="5" style="color:white;">You can buy assets that have been tokenized into NFTs through any NFT marketplace and some cryptocurrency exchanges. Many NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea, are hosted on the Ethereum platform and may require you to own Ether (ETH) to buy an NFT.</font></p>
